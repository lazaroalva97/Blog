I largely credit my passion for data because of my grandparents and I was lucky enough to spend a lot of time with them growing up. I remember watching football with my grandparents and I was always intrigued when the commentators would speak statistics such as "XX team leads the league in 3rd down conversions" or "With a win today XX team has a 75% of making the playoffs". At the time I thought these commentators were the smartest people in the world and little did I know that there was actually a statistician running these numbers in the background. 

This passion carried me through my education and I majored in Economics to learn the science behind decision making using mathematics and analysis. I decided to continue my education in analytics and I am part of the first class of the MS in Business Analytics from UT-Rio Grande Valley. 

Now I'm working in the government/public sector and this passion has continued to fuel me. What I love about being a Data Scientist is that you never stop learning and you never stop solving problems.

R programming is my strongest analytical tool and I'm proficient in the following R Packages;
dplyr, tidymodels, caret, ggplot2, plotly, Rmarkdown, shiny, DT, openxlsx

Other languages: Python (Anaconda 3), SQL, HMTL, CSS 
Quant Skills: Data Modeling, Machine Learning, Statistical Analysis, Visualization
